**By using Learn the Web, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.**

---

## Definitions

We’re going to use some shorthand to make this easier to read. When we say “site” or “website”, we mean [learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/) and the services offered through that site. When we say “we,” “us,” or “our,” we mean Learn the Web (Thomas J Bradley), an Ontario business.

---

## Country of origin

**Recognize that is website is run by an entity within Canada and that much of the content & data is stored outside of Canadian borders.**

---

## Personal information

We do not collect personal information or use any personal information.

### Feedback forms

We have two feedback forms: an [anonymous course feedback form](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/feedback/) & a [team project reflection form](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/courses/shared/team-reflection/). Both forms are submitted using Formspree.

  <br>[Refer to Formspree’s privacy policy for detailed information](http://docs.formspree.io/files/privacy.pdf)
  <br>Information submitted through email forms is retained by Formspree servers for one month & transmitted through email to our accounts.

**The anonymous course feedback form collects no personal information.** This anonymous information is transmitted for Formspree’s servers and forwarded to our email accounts. This information may be kept in our email accounts for an unknown period of time.

**The team reflection feedback form collects only names of you and your team members.** This information is transmitted to Formspree servers and forwarded to our email accounts. This information will be retained until final grades for the term are submitted, about two weeks after term end, at which point the information will be deleted from our email accounts.
